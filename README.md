## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **OUYA-styled, clean UI**
  - Color scheme and layout designed specifically for the OUYA.
  - Custom buttons and logos drawn for a cohesive console look.

- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight**
  - Optimized for the OUYA’s Android 4.1.2 base.
  - Caches app icons for quick grid rendering.

- 🕹️ **Controller-only navigation**
  - Designed to be fully controllable with the OUYA gamepad (no mouse/keyboard required).
  - All management actions are mapped to the OUYA face buttons and shoulder triggers.

- 📁 **Automatic app discovery via `ouya_icon.png`**
  - On first launch, OUYAlaunch scans **all installed apps** for an `ouya_icon.png` somewhere in their `res/` folders.
  - Icons are cached so the launcher grid stays responsive even with many installed games.

- ⭐ **Favorites and genre tabs**
  - Apps are organized into multiple tabs (Favorites + 6 genres).
  - By default, all newly detected apps land in the second tab **“Casual”**, so you can re-organize them at your own pace.

- 🏷️ **Configurable genre names (JSON-based)**
  - Rename the six genre tabs via a simple JSON config stored on the OUYA’s internal storage.
  - No in-app settings screen needed — just edit the JSON file with a text editor or file manager.

## 🚀 How it works (first launch & app scan)

On the **first launch**:

1. OUYAlaunch scans all installed apps on the console.
2. For each package it looks for an `ouya_icon.png` anywhere inside the app’s `res/` folder.
3. Matching icons are **cached** so the launcher can draw the app grid quickly.
4. Every found app is initially placed into the **“Casual”** tab (second tab) — you can then move each app into the genre that fits best.

This makes OUYAlaunch a good drop-in replacement for the stock OUYA launcher while still respecting the familiar OUYA icon convention.

## 🎮 Controller mapping

OUYAlaunch does not have a classic “settings” menu.  
Instead, you control everything with the OUYA controller buttons:

- **O** – Launch the selected app  
- **U** – Move the selected app to the **next genre tab**  
- **Y** – Delete an app (hold for ~2 seconds)  
- **A** – Mark / unmark an app as **Favorite**

Navigation and global actions:

- **L1 / R1** – Switch between tabs (Favorites + genre tabs)  
- **L2 + R2 (pressed together)** – Rescan all installed apps (rebuilds the cache)  
- **D-Pad / Left stick / Right stick** – Move selection in the app grid  

Everything in the launcher can be reached using only the OUYA controller.

## 🧩 Renaming genre tabs (JSON config)

Since version **1.5+**, you can rename the six genre tabs using a JSON file created by the launcher on first scan.

The config file is stored at:

    sdcard/android/data/com.ast.ouyalaunch

Inside that folder you will find a JSON file that looks like this:

    {
      "Favorites": "Favorites",
      "Genre1": "Casual",
      "Genre2": "Action",
      "Genre3": "Racing",
      "Genre4": "Simulation",
      "Genre5": "RPG",
      "Genre6": "Apps"
    }

- Do **not** rename the keys (`"Genre1"` ... `"Genre6"`).  
- Only change the **values** on the right side (e.g. `"Racing"`, `"Apps"` etc.).  
- You can edit the file directly on the OUYA with a file manager such as *Total Commander* or on a PC and then copy it back.

The launcher will read these values and update the tab titles the next time it runs.
